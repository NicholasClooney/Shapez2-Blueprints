# Shapez 2 Blueprints Warehouse

My Blueprints for Shapez 2. Stored Safely in Git & Semantically Versioned.

## `tasks`

This is where the automation comes in.

Whenever I add a new file, update an existing file.
I can run `invoke version-and-commit` to

1. Track the iteration number of a blueprint
2. Commit the change with a automated message in Git
